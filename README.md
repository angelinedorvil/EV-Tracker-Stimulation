# LightningPower EV Charging Simulator

## Project Overview
This Python-based project simulates an Electric Vehicle (EV) charging network to manage the scale of infrastructure and demand for EV charging within various communities. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) using Pygame and Pygwidgets, offering insights into daily operations, costs, energy usage, and recommendations for station expansion based on simulation results.

## Key Features
- **GUI for Interaction**: Easy navigation through a window, buttons, and graphical elements.
- **Simulation of Charging Operations**: Daily cost, energy usage, and saturation of each charging station.
- **Dynamic Addition of Charging Stations**: Ability to add new EV charging stations to the simulation.
- **Comprehensive Results Display**: Including the total number of EVs charged per day/week, vehicles not charged, total charging cost, and suggestions for new charger locations.

## Technologies Used
- Python for the core logic.
- Pygame for creating the GUI.
- Pygwidgets for additional GUI components.

## Setup and Running the Project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python, Pygame, and Pygwidgets are installed.
3. Run `main.py` to start the simulation.

## Challenges and Learning Outcomes
Throughout this project, the main challenges involved managing the GUI interactions, simulating realistic charging station operations, and dynamically updating simulation results based on user inputs. Solutions were found through iterative development, extensive testing, and leveraging Python's object-oriented programming capabilities for scalable code structure.

## Future Directions
- Integration with real-world data for more accurate simulation.
- Expansion to include more detailed analytics on energy consumption patterns.
- Deployment of a web-based version for broader accessibility.
